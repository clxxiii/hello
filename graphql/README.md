# GraphQL Demo Project

This repo is here to help showcase the super-basics of how GraphQL works, and how to implement it in Javascript.

> [!NOTE]
> Parts of this repo are **overcommented**. The intention is to show off GraphQL, not show off typescript, which is what this is written in.
> As a result, some files have more comments than they need.
